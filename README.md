This is starter code for the back-end for COSC203 assignment 2.

It's similar to assignment 1, except it has an [Express Server for path routing](http://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html), and uses [EJS for Server-Side Rendering (SSR)](https://ejs.co/). The provided code still uses `nzbird.json` --- so your first task should be to replace it with a SQL database.
